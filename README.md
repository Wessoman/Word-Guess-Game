# Word Guess Game

Do you like Krautrock? No? Well too bad.
But if you do, say hello to my Krautrock game.
Try to guess the name of a Krautrock band in a "hangman" style game.

Due to the limitations of my coding ability:
All bands with two names, like "Amon Duul";
are going to be listed with one name, like so:
AMONDUUL
TANGERINEDREAM etc.

If you don't know much about Krautrock, you can read the article on Wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock
Note that all the bands listed in the article are not used,
and I put some bands in that are not listed (Like Sand and Brainticket!).

There are also acts that recorded in Germany at the time but weren't German,
Like DEVO, DavidBowie, IggyPop, and Nektar!

Give it a try and see if you like it.
Press Spacebar to start playing.
I am trying to work on the sound.
